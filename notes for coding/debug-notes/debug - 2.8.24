Arcade Drive is working yay

Bugs:
Left Stick does turning motion instead of forward
  Shooter front
  Left Side moving backward
  Right Side moving forward

Right stick turns opposite direction to stick movement
  Left turns right
  Right turns left

Shooter runs with motors (not supposed to happen)

To Debug:

Left stick: Make both sides move together

Right stick: reverse motor turning movements
