During the competition, we:

- added DPad movement (only fully works on intake side)
- added amp function (spits note out, won't go in amp)
- commented amp arm code (no smoking)
- added new drive back auto code
- edited auto min to scoot back


Now we should:
- make autoMin for right side turn
- make two note auto
- test limit switch once added
